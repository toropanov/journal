title: From Intention to Action! First post!
---

For the first post on my blog, I am excited to delve into the transformative power of habits.

Our environment and the people we interact with on a daily basis have a significant impact on us. I firmly believe that those we choose to surround ourselves with should serve as sources of inspiration.

The quotation of Richard Tirendi says:

> If you’re the smartest person in the room, you’re in the wrong room.

The notion lingered in my mind, compelling me to ponder deeply. In hindsight, I realize that several significant failures resulted from my tendency to abandon pursuits prematurely or opt for easier routes, influenced by my surroundings.

Success is not instantaneous; it demands consistent effort and discipline. Habits cultivated over time pave the way to triumph, which necessitates daily hard work and bravery. Eminem once famously said:

> Success is the only motherfucking option, failure is not!

After conducting some research on my personal productivity levels, I discovered that mornings are the most conducive time for me to tackle important tasks. Additionally, there are fewer distractions in the morning, which allows me to concentrate more effectively on my top priorities. As a result, I have resolved to cultivate a new habit of waking up at 7:30 AM by committing to this routine for 21 consecutive days. Upon completion of this three-week period, I anticipate that early rising will enhance my productivity significantly.

Robin Sharma's term "Mind over mattress" aptly characterizes the approach I am taking to boost my productivity.

### What's next?

While future posts on the blog will be primarily focused on web development and Mac OS tips.
